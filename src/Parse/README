This is the grammar of expressions calculusbot understands. Note that every
function is a single statement of the form "f(...) = expr", where ... indicates
some number of variables (assumed to be real numbers) and expr is some expression
from the following grammar. Note that initially, we will only support functions
of a single real-valued argument, that must be called "x". Note that before we
even do that, we're just going to represent polynomials.

expr ::= term binop expr | (expr) | term
term ::= factor * x^factor | factor
factor ::= digit+
binop ::= + | -


And the statement grammar:

stmt ::= f(x) = expr
