This is for future Ben, if he feels like working on this some more.

Easy things to re-familiarize yourself with code:
    - Improve simplification
        - make it combine (Const (IntLit x)) expressions
        - evaluate trig functions, etc at 0, or 1, or whatever is easy for them
    - Add more functions (inverse trig functions are a big one)
    - Function evaluation

Real improvements:
    - Integration (probably without convergence testing, at first)
